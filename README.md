# Clicky-Game

<p>This is a memory game built with React. I used Indiana Jones characters as an idea.</p>

<p>The goal of this game is not to click on any character more than once. If you select a chracter for second time the game will restart and if all characters are selected once, the selected characters will reset.</p>
